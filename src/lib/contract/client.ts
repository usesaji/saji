 * Direct Soroban contract client for the Saji savings contract.
 *
 * Uses the generated TypeScript bindings (src/lib/contract/savings) to call the
 * contract straight from the browser — building, simulating, signing (via the
 * connected wallet), and submitting, all client-side. This bypasses the backend
 * for on-chain actions, so it isn't affected by the backend's network access.
 *
 * Contract id, passphrase and RPC all come from `stellar-network` so they can
 * never disagree — the generated bindings' baked-in `networks.testnet` is
 * deliberately NOT used, since it would pin mainnet builds to a testnet
 * contract.
